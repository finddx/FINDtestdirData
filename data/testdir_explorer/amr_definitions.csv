True POC,"True POC platforms enable testing at the lowest level healthcare settings such as primary care centres (Level 1), as well as community (Level 0) and at-home testing.  

The main features of True POC platforms are: (i) Handheld or portable (i.e. can be carried, usually below < 5kg), (ii) Power-free, battery-operated or portable charger compatible, (iii) Require no special skills to perform the test (can be done by lay users or health workers) and (iv) Independent of laboratory infrastructure / equipment and all necessary materials and reagents included in the kit. 
Example: Lateral flow assays, handheld molecular devices. ",Laboratory / point-of-care (POC)
Near POC,"Near POC platforms enable testing in intermediate referral facilities, such as district hospital laboratories and small health clinics (Level 2). 

The main features of Near POC platforms are: (i) Intermediate size (i.e. benchtop, but not portable), (ii) Require basic technical/laboratory skills (can be done by laboratory technicians, but not specialists) and (iii) Dependent on basic laboratory infrastructure / equipment (e.g. mains electricity, clean water, controlled environment, pipettes, vortex mixers).
